- go through list from SK and generate all necessary plots
- get bad_read_mapping objective function working
- run objective functions on all soapdt assemblies
- 3d plot objective function results from all soapdt assemblies
- write optimisation algorithms:
-- gradient descent
-- genetic algorithm
-- Theano graphical model-based
