{"name":"biopsy","tagline":"An automatic optimisation framework for bioinformatics","body":"### *biopsy* optimises your bioinformatics tools and pipelines\r\n\r\nMany computation biology tools have long running times and many parameters, and different parameter settings are optimal for different input datasets. This makes choosing the best parameters for a given tool very difficult, so that we typically have to settle for our best-guess settings, or just use the defaults. *biopsy* tackles this problem by reducing tools and pipelines to parameter spaces in an optimisation problem, and rapidly learning the optimal settings.\r\n\r\nUnder development - check back later.","google":"UA-42040000-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
