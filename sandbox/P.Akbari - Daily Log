With help from R.Smith set up environment and familiarised myself with the project and the SOAP Denovo Trans Algorithm (Soapdt)
Current task: Produce a script to input a sweep of parameters to Soapdt

Completed script to input sweep of algorithms to Soapdt, recieved further help from R.Smith
Next task: Analyse output of parameter sweep on Soapdt applying objective function to results to produce a optimisation algorithm which varies the input parameters.

Parameter sweep algorithm written above completed as expected, output saved in outputdata folder.
Wrote script (output_file_size_check.rb) to check select output file size for each of the assemblies. Used this to check scafSeq.gz sizes.
