With help from R.Smith set up environment and familiarised myself with the project and the SOAP Denovo Trans Algorithm (Soapdt)
Current task: Produce a script to input a sweep of parameters to Soapdt

----16/07/2013----
Completed script to input sweep of algorithms to Soapdt, recieved further help from R.Smith
Next task: Analyse output of parameter sweep on Soapdt applying objective function to results to produce a optimisation algorithm which varies the input parameters.

----17/07/2013----
Parameter sweep algorithm written above completed as expected, output saved in outputdata folder.

Wrote script (output_file_size_check.rb) to check select output file size for each of the assemblies.
	Results merged with outputdata/filenameToparameters.csv (produced by combinate_params.rb) in: outputdata/filenameToParameters_scafSeq.gzSizes.csv

Currently writing script (leaff_scafSeq_extract.rb) to apply leaff algorithm on scafSeq files stored in outputdata folder. Response saved in: outputdata/leaff_output.csv
	Using stored scafSeq.gz file sizes to prevent running empty scafSeq.gz files in leaff

----18/07/2013----
leaff_scafSeq_extract.rb finished
Load data into r, merged the two csv files (outputdata/filenameToParameters_scafSeq.gzSizes.csv and outputdata/leaffoutput.csv) saved as outputdata/merged_leaff_soapdt.csv
Plotting and visualising data in R

----19/06/2013----
Completed plotting of input params into soapdt and output from leaff
Began refactor of combinate_params.rb code (in combinate_params_refactor.rb) to contain a ParameterSweeper class

----22/06/2013----
combinate_params.refactor.rb - nearly complete, adding constructor functionality
