Dealing with user defined time constraint
=============================
Discussing strategies for dealing with the time constraint set by user.

Aggressive convergence
-----------------------------
When predifined time constraint is approaching algorithm begins path of aggresive convergence, increasing selective pressure and hillwalk components (at the expense of population diversity which is irrelevent near end time).


Initial conditions
-----------------------------
Changing the initial conditions (initially or in realtime) depending on the time constraint.

* mutation rate, a high mutation rate will increase initial convergence but hinder near perfect convergence
* hillwalk, will increase convergence to local maxima (which may include global maxima depending on population diversity)
* initial population size, very imporant factor dictating the time of convergence. Difficult to tell relationship between population size and convergence without prior testing.
