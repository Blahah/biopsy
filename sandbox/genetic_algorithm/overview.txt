Overview of Genetic Algorithm
====================
Overview of algorithm including points of ambiguity (choices to be made) in the function of algorithm

Consants:
--------------------
SELECTIVITY = %
MUTATION_RATE = %

Global Variables:
--------------------
(explained in context below)
$paramter_ranges = {} # hash
$current_generation = {[], [], []} # hash of arrays
$generation_birth_rate = 0 # counter

Function of algorithm:
---------------------
# hash of all paramters and the ranges they can take
$paramter_ranges = {} # USE THIS TO ASSIGN PARAMETERS WHICH DO NOT MUTATE

# array of current paramter set seperated by comma
$current_generation = {[], [], [], []}

# score current generation, add score to array
.....

# pick top SELECTIVITY% of current generation and mate

# roll dice, introduce mutation 5% of the time
# use $paramter_ranges = {}, select a new random paramter

# set a new $current_generation
--Is this a good idea?
# if parents have higher score discard children
# if children have a higher score discard parents, add +1 to $generation_birth_rate


Choices To be made
---------------------
How to pick suitable values for:
SELECTIVITY
MUTATION_RATE

How to select the first parameter set
(representing the first $current_generation)

When to stop the algorithm
