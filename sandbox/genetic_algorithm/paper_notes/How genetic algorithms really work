How genetic algorithms really work - Notes
===================
[http://muehlenbein.org/mut92.pdf](Link to pdf)

Ideas tested against:
ONEMAX function
	Returns the number of ones in the input strung (optimum solution is all 1's)
(k,l)-deceptive function
	Contains two local maxima and one isolated global. Algorithm is pulled towards local
EQUAL function
	Many global maxima

Different variations of genetic algorithm perform differently against the above three scenarios.


Hillclimbing
--------------------
Adding Hillclimbing to an algorithm aims to reduce the computationally expensive final parameter changes prior to a perfect result.

Two types of hillclimbing

**next ascent na**
Each bit flipped individually (in predefined sequence) flip only accepted if net improvement observed

**steepest ascent sa**
All of the remaining bits flipped, bit resulting in the largest imporvement is actually flipped.
